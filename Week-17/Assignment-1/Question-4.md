# Question 4: Explain the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that are essential for ensuring the reliability, integrity, and correctness of database transactions. These properties collectively help maintain the accuracy and integrity of the database, even in the face of failures or errors. Let's explore each of the ACID properties in more detail:

## 1. Atomicity:

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. In other words, either all the operations within a transaction are executed successfully, or none of them are executed at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its initial state, ensuring that the database remains consistent. Atomicity guarantees that a transaction leaves the database in a valid state, regardless of any failures that might occur during its execution.

## 2. Consistency:

Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. In other words, a transaction should ensure that the data adheres to predefined rules and constraints after it is executed. The consistency property prevents transactions from leaving the database in an invalid or incomplete state. It maintains data integrity and preserves the integrity constraints of the database schema.

## 3. Isolation

Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can be executed concurrently without interfering with each other. Each transaction is isolated from other transactions until it is committed. This prevents the effects of one transaction from being visible to other transactions until the first transaction is completed. Isolation helps maintain data integrity and prevents issues such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads that can occur when transactions are executed concurrently.

## 4. Durability:

Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent failures, including power outages, crashes, or system errors. The changes made by a committed transaction are stored in a way that they can be recovered even if the system crashes. This property ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even in the face of hardware or software failures.
